PIZZA at 60 FPS By: Joseph Wegmann
**********************************
My way of starting the project is to go through lesson 4 thru 6. And after each one check to see what can be fixed.

Post Lesson 4 JS
- In this lesson the emphasis was requestAnimationFrame and Web Workers.
- When looking at main.js it seems that we may not need to add requestAnimationFrames or Web Workers at the moment. 

Post Lesson 5 Styles and Layout
- Clearly there is a FSL within the pizza webstite.
- First FSL fix required me to get rid of determinedx function and simplify the changePizzaSizes function. 
- The second FSL had to do with the pizza background scrolling. To fix this I took the property that was triggering teh FSL out of the for loop and assigned it to a variable.
